<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img height=100% width=200 src=https://schulplaner.firebaseapp.com/img/screenshots/screen7.png>

**What makes the app special?**

It's the upgrade for your school day. From now on, you no longer have to tediously enter your homework and timetable alone. The school planner connects you with all your classmates. If someone enters his or her homework, it is immediately available to all the others. So you'll never forget your homework again! 


### Built With

* [flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* [Material Design](https://material.io/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Structure

- *app:* This is the app itself, a cross-platform project based on flutter.
- *cloud_functions:* Scripts that handle the server-side functions of the app.
- *packages:* Outsourced Flutter Packages from /app. By moving functions to /packages, we can achieve a tidier code base.
- *schulplaner_website:* The official website.
- *web_app:* Temporary only, this is where the web version of /app is saved and finally uploaded.
- *utils:* The vacation databases in JSON format.
- *security_rules:* Security rules for Google's Firestore and Firebase
